# Computer-Vision-Project

These are the programs we used.

For template matching change the path of template and the image in the program. It should give an output as 'res.png' file in which the template is detected and bound by a box.
The function which retrieves all the templates (rotated and scaled) from a folder is commented out. The templates together were large in size, so, they couldn't be uploaded.
