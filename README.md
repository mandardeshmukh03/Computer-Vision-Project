# Computer-Vision-Project

These are the programs we used for object detection. These are wriiten in python.

For template matching change the path of template and the image in the program. It should give an output as 'res.png' file in which the template is detected and bound by a box.
The function which retrieves all the templates (rotated and scaled) from a folder is commented out. The templates together were large in size, so, they couldn't be uploaded. 
The function that changes the brightness and scaling are commented, so that they can be used when necessary. We can tweak the values to our liking.
